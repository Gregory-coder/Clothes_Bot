# Clothes bot
## Short introduction
Hey! I'm from Moscow, Russia and this is my school project, so this bot was created for people, who know Russian. But I think that, if you read the instruction carefully, you'll be able to use the bot even if you don't know Russian. If you want to use or test it, click [here](https://t.me/lit_clothes_bot).
## Instruction
Some basic commands are:
* ```/start``` - welcome message
* ```/instruction``` - instruction
* ```/add_clothes``` - add new clothes
* ```/delete_clothes``` - delete clothes
* ```/what_to_wear``` - shows what you can put on
* ```/my_clothes``` - shows the clothes you have already added
* ```/commands``` - a list of commands
### Start
When you enter ```/start```, the bot sends you a welcome message and offers to enter ```/instruction``` to learn more about this bot.
### Instruction
When you enter ```/instruction```, the bot sends you a message with the short description of the bot and some advice how to use it.

## How it works?
When the user enters ```/what_to_wear```, the bot asks him/her to share his/her location. And then the bot asks OpenWeatherMap about the current weather and the forecast in the place where the user is. The bot looks for the clothes, which are good for such weather.
