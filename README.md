# Clothes bot
## Short introduction
This Telegram bot was created to help people to choose right clothes in different weather conditions. Unfortunately, the **bot speaks only Russian**. But I think, if you read the instruction carefully, you'll be able to use the bot even if you don't know Russian. If you want to use or test it, find it on Telegram (**@lit_clothes_bot**) or click [here](https://t.me/lit_clothes_bot).
## How it works?
When the user enters ```/what_to_wear```, the bot asks him/her to share his/her location. And then the bot asks OpenWeatherMap about the current weather and the forecast in the place where the user is. The bot looks for the clothes, which are good for such weather.
## Instruction
Some basic commands are:
* ```/start``` - welcome message
* ```/instruction``` - instruction

* ```/delete_clothes``` - delete clothes
* ```/what_to_wear``` - shows what you can put on
